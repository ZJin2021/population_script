## **Usage**

---

```python
usage: get_distances_normal.py [-h] [-m 5] [-o <out_dir>]
                              <SVs.vcf> <group.txt> <SP>
                               <reference.fasta.fai> <100000>


Get Jaccard similarity between one_group and others.

positional arguments:
  <SVs.vcf>             SV vcf file with support vectors.
  <group.txt>           Second column is the phylogenetic group, first column
                        is the accession
  <SP>                  Group to compare to other groups
  <reference.fasta.fai>
                        Fasta index file for the reference genome
  <100000>              Introgression window size.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m 5                  minimum number of SVs needed to calculate Jaccard
  -o <out_dir>          the out dir of saving results

```
